## What is it?

1. Word clouds are a natural language mining tool designed to show common words across a source.
2. In this case the source is Call of C'Thulhu by H.P. Lovecraft, a most unusual story of intrigue and madness.
3. The word cloud allows the user to identify the most common words used in the story.

## Why do you need it?

1. Lovecraft has a very distinct and verbose style of writing, so it's valuable to see what words he uses most frequently in his most famous work.
2. Given Lovecraft's distinctive style it is valuable to see what words are most repeated.

## Why is the world worse without it?

1. If we included all of Lovecraft's writing we would see a very different view full of hideous dreams, gibbous moons, and cyclopean ruins because similar themes travel across his works.
2. Because of the similar themes in other works this total wordcloud doesn't give a complete view of his style, so it's good for the world to see Lovecraft as more than a spirit of multisilabulary madness.

## In conclusion
According to this R calculation, the world has been improved up to 
``2``%
by the addition of this relatively pointless shiny app.
